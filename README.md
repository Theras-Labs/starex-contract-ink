# Ink Contract Development Overview

## Introduction

This document outlines the development process of an ink contract, aiming to transform an existing Solidity contract into ink. The project focuses on gradual implementation, with plans for future upgrades and integration of additional functionalities.

### Current Status

The developer is relatively new to ink smart contract development. Challenges have been encountered during the integration with delegate call and differences between v4 and v5, highlighting the learning curve associated with ink contract development.

### Missing Goals | on Ink Next Steps

- **Upgradeable Contract**: Ensure the contract's upgradability to accommodate future enhancements and optimizations.
- **Offchain Integration**: Integrate offchain functionalities using EIP712 or ECDSA for enhanced security and efficiency.
- **Airdrop NFT Pool**: Implement a mechanism for NFTs pool through airdrops and for airdrops.
- **Payment Integration**: Enable payment functionalities with ERC20 and PSP-22 standards for interoperability and versatility.
- **Tokenized System**: Create a tokenized ecosystem within the contract for managing assets and transactions.
- **Staking**: Develop staking functionalities to incentivize participation and secure the network.

## Development Process

### Transformation from Solidity

The primary objective is to convert an existing Solidity contract (accessible [here](https://github.com/Theras-Labs/starex-evm-contract-v2)) into ink. This process involves translating the logic and structure while adapting to ink's syntax and features.

### Testnet Deployment

The ink contract has been deployed on two testnets:

- **Rococo Testnet**: [Contract Address](#) - [Hashcode](#)
- **Shibuya Testnet**: [Contract Address](#) - [Hashcode](#)

## on Solidity Next Steps

- **Iterative Improvements**: Continuously refine the contract's functionality and optimize performance.
- **ERC404 Integration**: Explore integration with ERC404 for enhanced token management.
- **Token Boundary Expansion**: Extend the contract's capabilities to manage a broader range of tokens and assets.
- **Community Feedback**: Gather feedback from the developer community to identify areas for enhancement and refinement.

## Conclusion

The ink contract development represents the initial step towards building a robust and versatile decentralized application ecosystem. Despite challenges, dev remains committed to iteratively improving the contract and expanding its functionalities in alignment with project objectives to accomplish the cross-chain game, and introduce collaboration in community.
